Installation
============
    There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3 and above

Project Motivation
==================
  I used Black Friday Data (2018) from Kaggle to understand the spending characterstics of city residence on a particular sale date. How retail shops can arrange their products based on the gender, their shopping character and age. This study is part of course that are owned by Udacity. This README serves as a template for others to follow in creating their own project README files.
  
File Descriptions
=================
  There is only jupyter notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. This file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict purchase amount.

Results
=======
  The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
====================================
  Must give credit to Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
